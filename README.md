  you can't edit the stories uploaded by other users.

  the comments you write (delete or rewrite), but you can't edit other users comments.

### Important Guidelines ###

* For the register page: do not using any symbol like %,$,&... which is not allowed.

### Creative Portion ###

* First, we add a function called forget password, which you can use to reset you password. If you click this button,
  you need enter your username and email address to verify yourself. Then, system will give a temporary password that you
  can login with it. After login, in the mainpage, you can reset your password to what you like.
* Second, we add the time function. When you post a story or comment, system will record your post time and show it in the
  mianpage under the time column.
